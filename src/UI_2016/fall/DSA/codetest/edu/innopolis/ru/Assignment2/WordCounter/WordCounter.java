/*
Statement
You are given a text file input.txt that consists of multiple lines in English.
You need to count distinct words (case insensitive) in this file considering constraints:
- You should use your own hash table implementation.
- Hash table is implemented using open addressing with double hashing probing technique.
- You should not consider {a, the, in, at, to, on, not, for, 's, 'd, 're, is, are, am, has, I, we, you}.
Count them firstly, but then delete after counting is done.
- Hash table size selection should be done wisely.
- For each line you create separate hash table. Results after counting should be merged.
- For an extra point you can implement parallel counting (separate for each line).
Your result in output.txt should consist of the most frequent lowercase word and its wordcount.
There's always only one most frequent word.

Example
input.txt
The Fox ran into the Woods.
The fox died.

output.txt
fox 2
